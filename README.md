Since I am too lazy thinking about what I should eat every day, I decided to write a small tool that generates a list of recipes for me to eat every month. This way I can easily plan out what ingredients I need to buy beforehand. The end goal is to have it even automaticaly buy the recipes from the REWE online shop.
